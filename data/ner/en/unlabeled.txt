All U
of U
it U

demeaning U
all U

During U

a U
lot U
of U
us U
did U
nt U
see U
the U
sexism U
You U
saw U
it U
You U
must U
ve U
been U
so U
frustrated U
I U
was U
aware U
of U
sexism U
Going U
into U
the U
profession U
in U
the U
law U
women U
were U
far U

outnumbered U
At U
the U
DAs U
office U
too U
On U
the U
18th U

there U
were U
four U

and U
three U
of U
them U
were U
for U

Still U
I U
was U
able U
to U
succeed U
I U
managed U
I U
did U
nt U
have U
to U
confront U
sexism U
on U
a U
regular U
basis U
I U
did U
nt U
have U
to U
think U
that U
much U
about U
it U
Until U
the U
Simpson U
trial U
I U
wind U
up U
in U
a U
courtroom U
full U
of U
men U
who U
are U
so U
profoundly U
sexist U
it U
was U
shocking U
And U
so U
it U
was U
a U
bit U
of U
a U
wakeup U
call U
for U
me U
What U
have U
your U
thoughts U
been U
watching U
the U
reconsideration U
of U
your U
treatment U
unfold U
I U
never U
thought U
it U
would U
happen U
Never U
The U
sexism U
at U

the U
trial U
was U
nt U
really U
something U
that U
anyone U
remarked U
on U
Some U
did U
but U
they U
were U
lone U
voices U
in U
the U
wilderness U
Until U
voices U
join U
together U
in U
a U
chorus U
nobody U
hears U
them U
Particularly U
women U
So U
it U
really U
was U
not U
something U
I U
thought U
anyone U
would U
ever U
care U
about U
or U
notice U
And U
then U
they U
did U
That U
year U
after U
the U

came U
out U

a U

It U

refreshing U
It U
was U
across U
the U

The U
men U
and U
the U
women U
had U
the U

reaction U
which U
was U
amazing U
I U
thought U
OK U
we U
really U
have U
moved U
forward U
There U
really U
has U
been U
progress U
There U
s U
a U
whole U
generation U
that U
looks U
at U
that U
and U
says U
What U
bullshit U
You U
really U
seem U
empowered U
It U
seems U
like U
I U
m U
seeing U
Marcia U
Clark U
unleashed U
Today U
especially U
when U
you U
said U
your U
message U
for U
men U
afraid U
to U
interact U
with U

was U
boofuckinghoo U
Do U
you U
feel U
more U
emboldened U
and U

by U
the U

I U
think U
I U
ve U
always U
been U
who U
I U
am U
I U
kind U
of U
did U
nt U
hold U
back U
in U
court U
either U
It U
got U
to U
a U
certain U
point U

in U
the U
trial U
when U
I U
realized U
he U
Judge U
Ito U
was U
not U
going U
to U
get U
any U
better U
There U
was U
no U
appeasing U
him U
Then U
Marcia U
Clark U
unleashed U
in U
that U
courtroom U
I U
definitely U
resorted U
to U
my U
own U
voice U
I U
m U
still U
just U
being U
me U
I U
think U
all U
of U
us U
are U
but U
maybe U
are U
feeling U
more U
empowered U
to U
speak U
out U
To U
say U
This U
is U
not U
OK U

say U
I U
do U
nt U
want U
to U

do U
nt U

on U

Obesity U
rates U
have U
risen U
dramatically U
over U

30 U

other U

can U

and U
in U

also U

Pepino U
says U
If U
we U
follow U
the U
results U
in U

a U
highfat U
diet U
would U
lead U
to U
less U
production U
of U

that U

could U
make U
a U

less U

From U
our U

in U

we U
would U
hypothesize U
that U
people U
with U

may U
make U
less U
of U

So U
it U
would U
seem U
logical U
that U
the U

can U
be U
modified U

by U
a U

Pepino U

due U
to U
the U
activity U
of U
an U
enzyme U
called U
lipase U
in U
the U
saliva U
that U
breaks U
the U
triglycerides U

releasing U
the U
fatty U
acids U
while U
the U
fat U
is U
still U
in U
the U
mouth U
Rats U
for U
example U
can U
produce U
salivary U
lipase U
and U
the U
lipase U
quickly U
will U
begin U
to U
digest U
the U
triglyceride U
and U
convert U
it U
into U
a U
fatty U
acid U
she U
explains U
In U
humans U
the U
role U
of U
lipase U
has U
nt U
been U
as U
clear U
In U
our U
experiments U
people U
could U
detect U
fat U
whether U
it U
was U
a U
triglyceride U
or U
a U
fatty U
acid U
But U
when U
the U
researchers U
added U
the U
diet U
drug U
orlistat U
subjects U
could U
still U
taste U
the U
fatty U
acids U

these U
go U
far U
enough U
Before U
Christmas U
the U
General U

the U

without U

the U

chytrid U
fungus U
is U
a U
singular U
fungal U
pathogen U
It U
has U
a U
swimming U
zoospore U
as U
the U
infectious U
stage U
It U

colonizes U
skin U
cells U
of U
adult U
amphibians U
and U
the U
mouthparts U
of U
tadpoles U
Infection U
occurs U
when U
zoospores U
land U
on U
the U
skin U
or U
the U
mouthparts U
and U
encyst U
Through U
mechanisms U
that U
are U
not U
fully U

the U
pathogen U
moves U
from U
the U
surface U
of U
the U
skin U
to U
the U
stratum U
granulosum U
of U
the U
epidermis U
and U
matures U
in U
the U
stratum U
corneum U
There U
it U
enters U
healthy U
cells U
grows U
in U
size U
and U
develops U
into U
an U

The U
mechanism U
by U
which U
this U
pathogen U
causes U
disease U
seems U
to U
be U
by U
interference U
with U
the U
ion U
transport U
functions U
of U
the U
skin U
leading U
eventually U
to U
cardiac U
failureWorldwide U
amphibian U
decline U
has U
been U
related U
to U
epidemics U
caused U
by U
the U
chytrid U
fungus U
One U
hypothesis U
to U
explain U
the U
global U
amphibian U
decline U
is U
that U
the U
chytrid U
fungus U
acts U
as U
a U
propagating U
pathogen U
that U
was U
taken U
out U
of U
Africa U
by U
wildlife U
trade U
of U
_ U
Xenopus U
_ U
spp U
However U
evidence U
indicates U
that U
this U
fungus U
is U
not U
the U
single U
cause U
of U
the U

worldwide U
amphibian U
decline U
it U
is U
not U
necessary U
nor U
sufficient U
to U
cause U
population U
declines U
Prevalences U
to U
various U
pathogens U
other U
than U
chytrid U
fungus U
were U
greater U
in U
declining U
amphibian U
populations U
than U
in U
nondeclining U
ones U
an U
indication U
that U
pathogens U
are U
affecting U
amphibian U
populations U
as U
it U
is U
also U
reported U
hereIt U
has U
been U
shown U
that U
global U
warming U
can U
degrade U
toads U
condition U
and U
that U
frog U
declines U
caused U
by U
the U
chytrid U
fungus U
were U
preceded U
by U
periods U
of U
increasing U
stress U
an U
indication U
that U
poor U
condition U
is U
implicated U
in U
population U
declines U
In U
addition U
it U
was U
found U
that U

the U
severity U
of U
the U
infection U
by U
chytrid U
depends U
on U
the U
vigour U
of U
the U
individual U
infected U
Moreover U
amphibians U
have U
also U
declined U
in U
areas U
where U
the U
fungus U
is U
absent U
and U
the U
fungus U
is U
sometimes U
present U
for U
long U
periods U
of U
time U
without U
causing U
disease U
Thus U
an U
impoverished U
condition U
resulting U
from U
environmental U
changes U
may U
be U
triggering U
vicious U
circles U
in U
which U
the U
chytrid U
fungus U
may U
be U
implicated U
that U
are U
decimating U
amphibian U
populations U
Fortunately U
there U
is U
evidence U
that U
the U
worldwide U
amphibian U
decline U
has U
slowed U
down U

that U

however U

economic U

which U
is U
about U
four U

there U
will U

be U
a U
floor U
of U
three U

There U
is U
much U
that U
can U
be U
criticized U
about U
this U
solution U
to U
the U

issue U
It U
appears U
to U
herald U

departure U
of U
the U

from U
any U
attempt U
at U

the U

At U

conclude U
that U

that U

the U

both U

the U
world U
should U
last U
so U
long U
The U
fact U
is U
the U
provinces U
have U
stable U
federal U
funding U
to U
plan U
for U
the U
day U
when U
growth U
in U
federal U
transfers U
slows U
Federal U
health U
transfers U
are U
a U
key U
component U
of U
provincial U
health U
spending U
accounting U
for U
about U
20 U
per U
cent U
of U
their U
expenditures U
and U
are U
therefore U
an U
important U
driver U
of U
spending U
The U
federal U
government U
is U
creating U
the U
incentive U
for U
provinces U
to U
bend U
the U
healthcare U
cost U
curve U
but U
gradually U
and U
without U
a U
onesizefitsall U
policy U
One U
of U
the U
advantages U
of U
a U
federal U
form U
of U
government U
is U
that U
it U
can U
foster U
diversity U
and U
innovation U
in U
the U
production U
and U
delivery U
of U
public U
services U
The U
provinces U

now U
have U
the U
opportunity U
to U
do U
just U
that U
to U
health U
care U
The U
money U
however U
is U
being U
transferred U
with U
no U
strings U
attached U
no U
push U
for U
national U
standards U
Those U
who U
might U
want U
to U
see U
future U
federal U
action U
on U
a U
national U
drug U
plan U
will U
be U
disappointed U
Those U
who U
see U
the U
role U
of U
the U
federal U
government U
as U
an U
enforcer U
of U
regional U
equity U
in U
healthcare U
services U
will U
also U
be U
disappointed U
Those U
provinces U
currently U
unhappy U
with U
the U
new U
transfer U
deal U
however U
would U
also U
cry U
lamentations U
of U
domineering U
federalism U
and U
unwarranted U
federal U
intrusion U
if U
the U
federal U
government U
became U
more U
interventionist U
in U
applying U
national U
heath U
standards U
The U
federal U
government U
has U
extricated U

itself U
from U
these U
types U
of U
political U
health U
funding U
operas U
and U
in U
future U
all U
the U
provinces U
will U
be U
more U
careful U
about U
what U
they U
wish U
for U
Finally U
the U
amounts U
are U
reasonable U
Six U
per U
cent U
until U
2017 U
means U
five U
more U
years U
of U
federal U
transfer U
growth U
well U
in U
excess U
of U
GDP U
growth U
Of U
course U
given U
population U
growth U
and U
inflation U
it U
means U
a U
freeze U
in U
real U
per U
capita U
federal U
health U
transfers U
after U
2017 U
This U
is U
where U
the U
challenge U
lies U
For U
provinces U
with U
booming U
economies U
and U
relatively U
young U
populations U
a U
freeze U
in U
real U
per U
capita U
federal U
health U
transfers U
will U
allow U
innovation U
and U
experimentation U
For U
provinces U
with U
rapidly U
aging U
populations U
and U

slower U
economic U
growth U
Eastern U
Canada U
the U
result U
will U
be U
a U
serious U
fiscal U
crunch U
Ontario U
and U
Quebec U
already U
have U
extremely U
challenging U
deficit U
and U
debt U
situations U
and U
they U
now U
see U
an U
express U
train U
rather U
than U
light U
heading U
towards U
them U
at U
the U
end U
of U
the U
fiscal U

All U
this U
will U
be U
in U
keeping U
with U
the U
new U
vision U
for U
Canadian U
federalism U

he U
quickly U
realised U

Thursday U

GMT U
Nearly U
threequarters U
of U
family U
doctors U
surveyed U
by U
the U
Royal U
College U
of U
General U
Practitioners U
want U
the U
government U
to U
withdraw U
the U
coalitions U
health U
and U
social U
care U
bill U
it U
has U
emerged U
In U
an U
online U
poll U
of U
doctors U
1900 U
out U
of U
2600 U
respondents U
said U
it U
was U
appropriate U
to U
pull U
the U
legislation U
even U
as U
it U
wends U
its U
way U
through U
the U
House U
of U
Lords U
When U
asked U
if U
the U
college U
which U
represents U
44000 U
doctors U
should U
call U
for U
the U
bill U
to U
be U
withdrawn U
jointly U
with U

other U
medical U
royal U
colleges U
more U
than U
98 U
of U
respondents U
said U
they U
strongly U
supported U
or U
supported U
such U
an U
action U
The U
figures U
strengthen U
the U
hand U
of U
the U
RCGP U
chair U
Clare U
Gerada U
who U
wanted U
to U
assess U
the U
views U
of U
the U
college U
membership U
before U
pushing U
forward U
with U
her U
own U
line U
which U
has U
been U
consistently U
critical U
of U
the U
bill U
Although U
the U
poll U
was U
selfselecting U
those U
who U
answered U
were U
largely U
negative U
about U
the U
legislation U
Nearly U
60 U
said U
the U
reforms U
would U
not U
result U
in U
more U
costeffective U
delivery U
of U
care U
and U
almost U
90 U
said U
the U
reforms U
would U
increase U
the U
involvement U
of U
the U
private U
sector U
The U
college U
wants U
the U
bill U
to U
be U

amended U
so U
the U
secretary U
of U
state U
is U
explicitly U
responsible U
for U
the U
health U
service U
and U
the U
private U
sector U
can U
not U
cherry U
pick U

The U

is U
expected U
to U
be U
held U
in U
the U
House U
of U

at U
the U

January U
so U
it U
is U
timely U
for U
us U
to U
reiterate U
our U
concerns U
and U
show U
the U
government U
that U
we U
want U
to U
continue U
working U
with U
them U
to U
bring U
about U
positive U
change U
for U
the U
benefit U
of U
our U
patients U
Andy U
Burnham U
the U
shadow U

said U
These U
results U
are U
devastating U
for U
Andrew U
Lansley U
It U
is U
hard U
to U
see U
how U
he U
can U
possibly U
carry U
on U
with U
his U
bill U
in U
the U
face U
such U

overwhelming U
professional U
opposition U
As U
we U
approach U
the U
firstyear U
anniversary U
of U
the U
introduction U
of U
this U
bill U
into U
parliament U
it U
is U
clear U
that U
the U
governments U
attempts U
to U
build U
a U
professional U
consensus U
behind U
it U
have U
abjectly U
failed U
People U
will U
ask U
how U
can U
plans U
that U
were U
meant U
to U
be U
based U
around U
GPs U
can U
possibly U
succeed U
when U
only U
two U
out U

a U
hundred U

A U
source U
close U

Lansley U
the U
health U
secretary U
dismissed U
the U
survey U
saying U
it U
was U
not U
an U
opinion U
poll U
and U
therefore U
had U
little U
credibility U
The U
source U
pointed U
out U
that U
6 U

If U
you U
watch U
the U
health U
reports U
on U
the U
news U
or U
read U
any U
health U
related U
material U
online U
or U
in U
print U
and U
you U
will U
generally U
run U
across U
some U
articles U
that U
are U
talking U
about U
the U
obesity U
epidemic U
in U
America U
and U
other U
countries U
There U
are U
a U
number U
of U
health U
issues U
that U
come U
from U
being U
overweight U
and U
many U
of U
them U
can U
be U
lethal U
if U
not U
treated U
One U
of U
the U
best U
treatments U
for U
the U
obese U
and U
the U
disorders U
that U
go U
with U
being U
overweight U
is U
exercise U
The U
catch U
is U
that U
some U
are U
simply U
too U
ill U
to U
exercise U
Researcher U
are U
now U
claiming U
that U
they U
have U
created U
a U
pill U
that U
is U

promised U
to U
give U
the U
person U
taking U
it U
the U
same U
benefits U
of U
exercise U
without U
having U
to U
exercise U
The U
hormone U
in U
the U
pill U
is U
being U
called U
irisin U
and U
occurs U
naturally U
in U
the U
body U
According U
to U
the U
researchers U
this U
hormone U
is U
found U
in U
normal U
muscle U
cells U
and U
triggers U
the U
calorie U
burning U
effects U
of U
exercise U
Experts U
from U
Harvard U
Medical U
School U
believe U
that U
the U
new U
hormone U
could U
lead U
to U
treatments U
for U
obesity U
diabetes U
and U
possibly U
even U
cancer U
along U
with U
all U
sorts U
of U
other U
conditions U
that U
can U
benefit U
from U
exercise U
So U
far U
the U
medication U
has U
been U
testing U
in U
mice U
and U
in U
tests U
the U
researchers U
found U
that U
glucose U
control U
improved U
and U
the U
mice U
lost U
small U

amounts U
of U
weight U
It U
will U
be U
a U
long U
time U
yet U
before U
the U
medication U
hits U
the U

We U

about U

But U
we U
wanted U
to U
know U
more U
about U
the U
persistence U
if U
any U
of U
pathogens U
once U
the U
animals U
have U
been U
slaughtered U
In U
a U
small U
study U
published U
Tuesday U
in U

PLoS U
ONE U
Marano U
and U

from U
several U

a U

They U
then U
ran U
sophisticated U
genetic U
tests U
to U
detect U

Sure U
enough U
the U
researchers U
found U
that U
several U

bugs U
had U
made U
the U
trip U
including U
diseases U
that U
belong U
to U
the U
same U
family U
as U
HIV U
which U
also U
originated U
in U
African U
bushmeat U
This U
is U
good U
example U
of U
why U
we U
want U
to U
know U
about U
these U
viruses U
We U
want U
to U
prevent U
any U
kind U
of U

It U
has U
also U
made U
the U
jump U

though U
it U
has U
yet U
to U
cause U
obvious U
symptoms U
Among U
the U
other U
pathogens U

found U
in U
the U
confiscated U
bushmeat U
were U
several U
forms U

all U
of U
which U
could U

We U

warned U

potential U

from U
close U

with U

that U
can U
bite U

noting U
that U
a U
living U

can U
create U
an U
infectious U
aerosol U
which U
bushmeat U
normally U
would U
not U
Pavlin U
said U
he U
was U
not U
surprised U
by U
the U
results U
of U
the U
Smith U
study U
My U
research U
has U
shown U
that U
there U
are U
myriad U
species U
of U
imported U
animals U
that U
are U
known U
to U
be U
potential U
carriers U
of U
zoonotic U
pathogens U
he U
said U
This U

study U
is U
the U
first U
to U
demonstrate U
virus U
directly U
in U
imported U
bushmeat U
but U
it U
basically U
confirms U
what U
we U
all U
suspected U
A U
person U
handling U
meat U
may U
be U
directly U
exposed U
to U
an U
animals U
blood U
and U
internal U
tissues U
which U
Pavlin U
said U
could U
be U
extremely U
dangerous U
particularly U
as U
the U
bushmeat U
being U
prepared U
may U
be U
doubledead U
In U
other U
words U
the U
animal U
may U
have U
initially U
died U
from U
disease U
before U
being U
found U
and U
processed U
for U
consumption U
This U
is U
the U
scenario U
that U
likely U
gave U
rise U
to U
the U
deadly U
Ebola U
virus U
People U
may U
also U
be U
exposed U
to U
disease U
by U
eating U
the U
bushmeat U
As U
with U
chicken U
and U
salmonella U
the U
level U
of U

risk U
depends U
on U
how U
well U
the U
meat U
is U
cooked U
but U
millions U
of U
Africans U
rely U
on U
bushmeat U
for U
protein U
and U
surveys U
of U
West U
African U
communities U
have U
found U
that U
many U
people U
are U
unaware U
that U
they U
could U
get U

Major U
disease U

are U
a U
very U
real U
risk U
when U
masses U

gather U

such U
as U
at U

Infectious U

Mass U
gatherings U
are U
a U

phenomenon U
that U
are U
not U
really U
all U
that U
understood U
said U
Khan U
lead U
author U
of U
the U
paper U
in U
an U
interview U
Historically U
when U
countries U
host U
mass U
gatherings U
they U
tend U
to U
focus U
their U
attention U
locally U
where U
the U
gathering U
is U
occurring U
he U
said U
They U
have U
control U
over U
that U
jurisdiction U
and U
can U
do U
whatever U
they U
need U
to U
do U
he U
explained U
The U
downside U
of U
that U
approach U
however U
is U
that U
by U
definition U
you U
re U
always U
then U
responding U
to U
an U
outbreak U
and U
not U
actually U
looking U
for U
ways U
to U
prevent U
it U
said U
Khan U
When U
people U
from U
around U
the U
world U
travel U
to U
one U
place U
for U
an U
event U
it U
is U
both U
a U
global U
and U
a U
local U
phenomenon U
he U
explained U
You U

have U
global U
populations U
that U
are U
converging U
in U
a U
single U
point U
he U
explained U
And U
then U
when U
the U
gathering U
is U
over U
then U
those U
individuals U
are U
diverging U
and U
going U
back U
to U
the U
places U
that U
they U
came U
from U
That U
makes U
the U
risk U
of U
disease U
outbreak U
challenging U
to U
monitor U
but U
Khan U
and U
his U
team U
have U
come U
up U
with U
a U
tracking U
system U
that U
combines U
two U
cuttingedge U
surveillance U
technologies U
The U
first U
is U
a U
system U
developed U
by U
John U
Brownstein U
one U
of U
the U
authors U
of U
the U
paper U
Browstein U
is U
from U
Montreal U
and U
is U
also U
an U
assistant U
professor U
of U
pediatrics U
at U
Harvard U
University U
and U
developer U
of U
HealthMaporg U
an U
Internetbased U
global U

infectious U
disease U
intelligence U
system U
The U
technology U
works U
by U
tracking U
potential U
outbreaks U
in U
realtime U
through U
constantly U
scanning U
the U
web U
to U
see U
what U
people U
are U
talking U
about U
online U
Its U
looking U
at U
social U
media U
trends U
and U
Twitter U
that U
kind U
of U
thing U
and U
looking U
for U
early U
signals U
of U
what U
types U
of U
infectious U
disease U
threats U
might U
be U
out U
there U
said U
Khan U
While U
government U
reports U
of U
outbreaks U
are U
accurate U
their U
value U
as U
a U
disease U
prevention U
tool U
is U
limited U
as U
the U
information U
takes U
weeks U
sometimes U
even U
months U
to U
gather U
As U
you U
can U
imagine U
during U
a U
mass U
gathering U
that U
lack U
of U
timeliness U
can U
be U
problematic U
he U
said U
But U
tracking U
diseases U

in U
real U
time U
allows U
for U
public U
health U
authorities U
to U
begin U
preparing U
for U
a U
potential U
outbreak U
before U
a U
major U
event U
even U
begins U
said U
Khan U
We U
usually U
start U
to U
focus U
our U
attention U
in U
the U
two U
weeks U
or U
so U
before U
a U
mass U
gathering U
and U
start U
really U
honing U
in U
on U
what U
types U
of U
disease U
outbreaks U
would U
be U
happening U
around U
the U
world U
he U
said U
Having U
too U
much U
information U
can U
be U
overwhelming U
said U
Khan U
To U
help U
narrow U
the U
search U
the U
technology U
is U
combined U
with U
the U
BioDiaspora U
a U
system U
Khan U
developed U
that U
uses U
air U
traffic U
patterns U
to U
predict U
the U
spread U
of U
infectious U
disease U
Its U
essentially U
understanding U
how U
the U
world U
is U
moving U

through U
the U
global U
airline U
transportation U
network U
Khan U
explained U
Since U
developing U
Bio U
Diaspora U
Khan U
has U
studied U
more U
than U
4000 U
airports U
700 U
airlines U
and U
the U
individual U
movements U
of U
over U
two U
billion U
passengers U
every U
year U
The U
information U
is U
anonymous U
he U
added U
In U
the U
weeks U
ahead U
of U
the U
London U
Olympic U
Games U
the U
two U
surveillance U
systems U
will U
allow U
health U
officials U
to U
anticipate U
disease U
outbreaks U
symptoms U
of U
which U
some U
British U
medical U
experts U
may U
have U
never U
even U
encountered U
before U
Now U
health U
officials U
can U
start U
to U
consider U
notifying U
frontline U
medical U
providers U
in U
saying U
there U
s U
a U
possibility U
someone U
with U
these U
symptoms U
and U
this U
type U
of U
disease U
may U
walk U
into U
your U
emergency U
room U
said U

Khan U
The U
main U
message U
said U
Khan U
is U
for U
people U
to U
make U
sure U
that U
they U
are U
healthy U
and U
have U
received U
their U

We U

Its U
dramatic U
news U
when U
a U
marathon U
runner U
collapses U
with U
no U
pulse U
Now U
a U
big U
study U
finds U
such U
calamities U
are U
rare U
and U
usually U
due U
to U
a U
preexisting U
heart U
problem U
The U
study U
also U
found U
such U
incidents U
are U
increasing U
as U
more U
runners U
try U
to U
go U
the U
distance U
You U
hear U
about U
this U
more U
and U

their U

Journal U

The U
study U
covers U
109 U
million U
runners U
who U
participated U
in U
marathons U
or U
halfmarathons U
in U
the U
United U
States U
from U
2000 U
to U
2010 U
By U
scouring U
media U
reports U
and U
checking U
with U
medical U
staff U
of U
races U
the U
researchers U
identified U
59 U
cases U
of U
cardiac U
arrest U
where U
a U
runner U
became U
unconscious U
with U
no U
pulse U
during U
the U
race U
or U
within U
an U
hour U
of U
finishing U
Cardiac U
arrest U
is U
when U
the U
heart U
stops U
because U
of U
a U
heart U
attack U
a U
rhythm U
problem U
or U
other U
disorder U
Fortytwo U
of U
the U
runners U
died U
The U
overall U
figures U
translate U
to U
1 U
cardiac U
arrest U
per U
184000 U
participants U
and U
1 U
death U
per U
259000 U

participants U
the U
researchers U
said U
Those U
numbers U
are U
low U
compared U
to U
other U
athletic U
activities U
as U
shown U
by U
prior U
studies U
of U
deaths U
in U
college U
athletes U
triathlon U
participants U
and U
previously U
healthy U
middleaged U
joggers U
researchers U
said U
Most U
of U
the U
cardiac U
arrests U
involved U
marathons U
rather U
than U
halfmarathons U
and U
51 U
of U
the U
59 U
cases U
happened U
in U
men U
More U
cases U
showed U
up U
during U
20052010 U
than U
in U
the U
preceding U
fiveyear U
span U
but U
that U
s U
just U
because U
more U
people U
are U
participating U
in U
the U
races U
Baggish U
said U
More U
worrisome U
was U
the U
finding U
that U
among U
male U
marathoners U
the U
rate U
of U
cardiac U
arrest U
per U
100000 U
runners U
was U
higher U
during U
the U

latter U
half U
of U
the U
decade U
than U
in U
the U
first U
half U
Baggish U
thinks U
that U
s U
because U
of U
a U
shift U
in U
attitudes U
about U
who U
can U
run U
long U
distances U
Even U
a U
decade U
ago U
262mile U
marathons U
were U
considered U
appropriate U
only U
for U
very U
athletic U
people U
he U
said U
But U
more U
recently U
people U
have U
come U
to U
think U
of U
it U
as U
something U
anyone U
can U
do U
and U
even U
as U
a U
healthy U
activity U
for U
lowering U
the U
risk U
of U
heart U
disease U
he U
said U
So U
it U
has U
attracted U
people U
with U
a U
family U
history U
of U
early U
heart U
disease U
or U
early U
deaths U
and U
these U
are U
just U
the U
people U
who U
are U
likely U
to U
get U
into U
trouble U
In U
the U
31 U
cardiac U
arrests U
for U
which U

researchers U
could U
find U
a U
cause U
most U
were U
due U
to U
clogged U
hardened U
arteries U
or U
hypertrophic U
cardiomyopathy U
a U
sometimes U
inherited U
condition U
in U
which U
an U
unusually U
thick U
heart U
muscle U
can U
interfere U
with U
the U
pumping U
rhythm U
Most U
of U
the U
victims U
were U
unaware U
of U
their U
preexisting U
conditions U
Baggish U
said U
Baggish U
said U
he U
would U
encourage U
aspiring U
and U
experienced U
runners U
to U
talk U
to U
their U
doctors U
about U
their U
heart U
risks U
for U
distance U
running U
Dr U
Gordon U
Tomaselli U
president U
of U
the U
American U
Heart U
Association U
called U
the U
study U
reassuring U
for U
finding U
so U
few U
cardiac U
arrests U
For U
most U
people U
running U
a U
marathon U
if U
you U

are U
so U
inclined U
is U
a U
reasonably U
safe U
proposition U
he U
said U
Tomaselli U
a U
heart U
specialist U
at U
Johns U
Hopkins U
University U
also U
said U
runners U
should U
pay U
attention U
if U
they U
feel U
chest U
pain U
dizziness U
lightheadedness U
or U
unusually U
short U
breath U
or U
rapid U
heartbeat U
while U
running U
You U
should U
listen U
to U
your U
body U
he U
said U
In U
the U
same U
issue U
of U
the U
journal U
other U
doctors U
wrote U
a U
brief U
report U
about U
treating U
three U

We U

USF U

convinced U
that U
money U
might U
be U
going U
to U
a U
cure U
that U
does U
nt U
exist U
A U
recently U
published U
study U
in U
the U
Journal U

Alzheimers U
Disease U
by U
Ming U
Chen U
an U
associate U
professor U
in U
the U
molecular U
pharmacology U
and U
physiology U
department U
suggests U
that U
Alzheimers U
in U
the U
elderly U
has U
no U
cure U
because U
it U
is U
not U
a U
disease U
but U
rather U
a U

misnomer U
for U
a U
natural U
condition U
caused U
primarily U
by U
age U
Over U
20 U
years U
I U
studied U
Alzheimers U
he U
said U
Then U
after U
the U
first U
10 U
years U
I U
started U
to U
realize U
that U
something U
might U
be U
wrong U
that U
turned U
things U
upsidedown U
Chen U
said U
that U
neurotransmission U
or U
the U
movement U
of U
signals U
sent U
through U
the U
brain U
is U
regulated U
by U
calcium U
While U
Chen U
expected U
calcium U
levels U
to U
decrease U
in U
a U
person U
with U
Alzheimers U
because U
of U
the U
symptoms U
of U
impaired U
brain U
function U
he U
found U
as U
did U
the U
medical U
community U
at U
large U
that U
calcium U
levels U
increased U
From U
there U
I U
realized U
something U
must U
be U
fundamentally U
wrong U
he U
said U
This U
is U
due U
to U
advanced U
aging U
plus U
risk U
factor U
The U

study U
lists U
inactive U
lifestyles U
and U
unhealthy U
food U
as U
risk U
factors U
that U
increase U
a U
persons U
chances U
of U
getting U
Alzheimers U
While U
people U
can U
lessen U
their U
risk U
with U
exercise U
and U
a U
healthy U
diet U
in U
the U
long U
run U
he U
said U
people U
wo U
nt U
be U
able U
to U
escape U
Alzheimers U
any U
more U
than U
they U
can U
escape U
death U
Chen U
said U
Alzheimers U
is U
better U
categorized U
in U
terms U
of U
senile U
dementia U
and U
presenile U
dementia U
dementia U
found U
in U
younger U
persons U
which U
he U

The U
causes U
of U
presenile U
dementia U
three U
mutant U
genes U
were U
not U
seen U
in U
senile U
dementia U

Chen U
likened U
the U
difference U
between U

senile U

presenile U
dementia U
to U
the U
difference U
between U
hearing U
loss U
found U

why U

For U

all U
people U
get U
hearing U

That U
is U

we U

that U
However U

or U

Chen U
said U
the U
controversial U
viewpoint U
isolated U
him U
from U
the U
medical U
community U
as U
few U
scientists U
agree U
with U
him U
There U
are U
a U
lot U
of U
scientists U
in U
USF U
but U
I U
wo U
nt U
name U
any U
of U
them U

to U
avoid U
controversy U
he U
said U
Our U
biggest U
challenge U
is U
getting U
grant U
funding U
To U
get U
a U
grant U
you U
have U
to U
make U
a U
proposal U
and U
the U
proposal U
is U
reviewed U
by U
scientists U
in U
a U
field U
a U
peer U
review U
That U
s U
the U
problem U
My U
views U
are U
different U
than U
the U
majority U
of U
the U
scientific U
community U
Dave U
Morgan U
CEO U
of U
the U
USF U
Health U
Byrd U
Alzheimers U
Institute U
said U
Chens U
argument U
has U
a U
few U
problems U
Two U
names U
George U
Burns U
and U
Betty U
White U
he U
said U
So U
if U
its U
normal U
aging U
they U
should U
have U
it U
They U
re U
both U
in U
their U
90s U
and U
they U
do U
nt U
have U
it U
So U
this U
is U
the U
problem U
with U
his U
argument U
If U
it U
was U
from U
old U
age U
everyone U

would U
have U
it U
Chen U
however U
said U
things U
are U
not U
so U
simple U
Its U
like U
a U
radio U
in U
the U
car U
he U
said U
You U
have U
an U
old U
radio U
that U
radio U
will U
eventually U
die U
because U
of U
aging U
not U
only U
radio U
but U
the U
whole U
car U
will U
die U
Not U
every U
car U
engine U
will U
overrun U
the U
radios U
lifespan U
There U
s U
always U
some U
cars U
dead U
with U
bad U
engine U
with U
bad U
radio U
but U
other U
cars U
dead U
with U
working U
radio U
Alzheimers U
will U
not U
affect U
everybody U
no U
matter U
how U
long U
we U
live U
Huntington U
Potter U
director U
of U
the U
Florida U
Alzheimers U
Disease U
Research U
Center U
said U
he U
agreed U
with U
Chen U
in U
regards U
to U
age U
itself U
being U
the U
No U
1 U
risk U
factor U
for U
developing U
Alzheimers U
But U
Alzheimers U
is U

a U
disease U
he U
said U
and U
all U
forms U
of U
disease U
are U
curable U
I U
think U
a U
disease U
should U
be U
defined U
by U
any U
physiological U
process U
that U
is U
detrimental U
to U
health U
or U
happiness U
he U
said U
So U
for U
any U
disease U
we U
seek U
scientists U
to U
prevent U
it U
or U
halt U
it U
or U
reverse U
its U
effects U
And U
possibly U
all U
three U
Potter U
said U
the U
medical U
community U
should U
focus U
on U
understanding U
the U
effects U
of U
aging U
on U
the U
brain U
as U
to U
figure U
out U
the U
pathology U
or U
cause U
of U
the U
disease U
and U
in U
doing U
so U
find U
a U
way U
to U
halt U
Alzheimers U
We U
know U
quite U
clearly U
that U
it U
is U
very U
common U
for U
you U
to U
get U
Alzheimers U
in U
your U
80s U
but U
it U
turns U
out U
if U

you U
reach U
the U
age U
of U
100 U
your U
risks U
go U
down U
Morgan U
said U
So U
that U
definitely U
proves U
that U
Alzheimers U
is U
not U
a U
function U
of U
aging U

it U

that U

However U
we U

that U

the U

momentum U
for U
a U

was U
soon U

some U

advocates U
argue U
deliberately U
kneecapped U
when U
the U
National U
Rifle U

the U
powerful U

issued U
a U

urging U
the U

to U
address U

via U

not U
law U
Under U
such U
a U
scenario U
the U
Bureau U
of U
Alcohol U
Tobacco U

or U
the U
ATF U
would U
close U
the U
loophole U

via U

We U

the U

is U
the U

Democrats U
however U
argue U
that U
congressional U
action U
is U
needed U
to U
codify U
a U
ban U
on U
bump U
stocks U
because U
a U
regulation U
can U
easily U
be U
overturned U
by U
a U
different U
administration U
They U
also U
note U
the U
ATF U
previously U
issued U
memos U
in U
2011 U
and U
2013 U
which U
said U
that U
existing U
gun U
laws U
do U
not U
provide U
sufficient U
authority U
to U
deem U
bump U
stocks U
illegal U
The U
ATF U
does U
NOT U
have U
the U
authority U

made U
this U
point U
clear U
to U
Congress U
MULTIPLE U

Feinstein U
proposed U
a U

ban U
in U
2013 U
that U
would U
have U
outlawed U
detachable U

on U
semiautomatic U

the U
measure U
never U

highly U
doubts U
the U

in U
a U

whether U
the U

that U

noted U
an U

aspect U

In U

Dr U

is U
one U
of U
36 U
IBD U
specialists U
in U
Alberta U
and U
he U
is U
trying U
to U
find U
out U
why U
the U
disease U
is U
impacting U
so U
many U
people U
in U
developed U
countries U
Researchers U
say U
they U
typically U
see U
more U
incidents U
of U
Crohns U
Disease U
and U
ulcerative U
colitis U
which U
are U
classified U
as U
IBD U
illnesses U
in U
Canada U
the U
United U
States U
and U
Europe U
They U
are U
looking U
at U

a U
link U
between U
industrialization U
and U
IBD U
Dr U
Kaplan U
says U
the U
Alberta U
IBD U
Consortium U
is U
looking U
at U
environmental U
factors U
that U
may U
be U
leading U
to U
more U
cases U
of U
IBD U
Where U
do U
we U
need U
to U
go U
next U
Identify U
the U
key U
gaps U
and U
that U
will U
then U
focus U
us U
on U
the U
right U
research U
that U
will U
lead U
us U
down U
the U
road U
and U
be U
able U
to U
eventually U
have U
better U
diagnosis U
better U
therapeutics U
and U
hopefully U
prevent U
the U
disease U
all U
together U
said U
Dr U
Kaplan U
Another U
theory U
they U
are U
investigating U
is U
whether U
a U
lack U
of U
Vitamin U
D U
increases U
the U
incidence U
of U
the U
disease U
in U
areas U
that U
get U
less U
sunlight U
like U
Canada U
Dr U
Kaplan U
says U
Canadians U

tend U
to U
stay U
indoors U

it U

get U

patients U
I U
think U
its U
just U
a U
problem U
in U
Alberta U

Canada U
and U
a U
lot U
of U
the U

countries U
that U
is U
just U
going U
to U
keep U
increasing U
until U
we U
can U
get U
a U
handle U
on U
what U
is U
causing U
it U
said U
Rievaj U
Researchers U
say U
in U
the U
last U
ten U
years U
they U
ve U
identified U
over U
100 U
genes U
that U
can U
make U
people U

to U
Inflammatory U

People U

The U

In U

for U

Thus U

be U
used U

can U
be U

until U

which U

It U

that U

Given U
that U
the U
MERSlike U
coronavirus U
in U

appears U
to U
be U
ubiquitous U
it U
remains U
to U
be U
explained U
why U
MERS U
in U

appears U
relatively U
rare U
Coronaviruses U
are U
well U
known U
to U
mutate U
to U
markedly U
change U
virulence U
or U
host U
range U
Examples U
are U
the U
emergence U
of U
the U
less U

porcine U
respiratory U
coronavirus U
from U
virulent U
transmissible U
gastroenteritis U
virus U
of U
pigs U
or U
virulent U
feline U
infectious U
peritonitis U
viruses U
emerging U
from U

Furthermore U
the U
SARSlike U

in U

other U
small U
mammals U
in U

markets U
in U

China U

initially U

to U
infect U
humans U
who U
appear U
to U
have U

with U

disease U
and U
onward U
transmission U
while U
a U
few U
amino U
acid U
changes U

the U

allowed U
that U

and U

in U

Thus U

their U

in U
Thursdays U

of U
the U
New U

Journal U
of U

The U
study U
covers U
109 U
million U
runners U
who U
participated U
in U
marathons U
or U
halfmarathons U
in U
the U
United U
States U
from U
2000 U
to U
2010 U
By U
scouring U
media U
reports U
and U
checking U
with U
medical U
staff U
of U
races U
the U
researchers U
identified U
59 U
cases U
of U
cardiac U
arrest U
where U
a U
runner U
became U
unconscious U
with U
no U
pulse U

during U
the U
race U
or U
within U
an U
hour U
of U
finishing U
Cardiac U
arrest U
is U
when U
the U
heart U
stops U
because U
of U
a U
heart U
attack U
a U
rhythm U
problem U
or U
other U
disorder U
Fortytwo U
of U
the U
runners U
died U
The U
overall U
figures U
translate U
to U
1 U
cardiac U
arrest U
per U
184000 U
participants U
and U
1 U
death U
per U
259000 U
participants U
the U
researchers U
said U
Those U
numbers U
are U
low U
compared U
to U
other U
athletic U
activities U
as U
shown U
by U
prior U
studies U
of U
deaths U
in U
college U
athletes U
triathlon U
participants U
and U
previously U
healthy U
middleaged U
joggers U
researchers U
said U
Most U
of U
the U
cardiac U
arrests U
involved U
marathons U
rather U
than U
halfmarathons U
and U
51 U
of U
the U
59 U
cases U
happened U
in U

men U
More U
cases U
showed U
up U
during U
20052010 U
than U
in U
the U
preceding U
fiveyear U
span U
but U
that U
s U
just U
because U
more U
people U
are U
participating U
in U
the U
races U
Baggish U
said U
More U
worrisome U
was U
the U
finding U
that U
among U
male U
marathoners U
the U
rate U
of U
cardiac U
arrest U
per U
100000 U
runners U
was U
higher U
during U
the U
latter U
half U
of U
the U
decade U
than U
in U
the U
first U
half U
Baggish U
thinks U
that U
s U
because U
of U
a U
shift U
in U
attitudes U
about U
who U
can U
run U
long U
distances U
Even U
a U
decade U
ago U
262mile U
marathons U
were U
considered U
appropriate U
only U
for U
very U
athletic U
people U
he U
said U
But U
more U
recently U
people U
have U
come U
to U
think U
of U
it U

as U
something U
anyone U
can U
do U
and U
even U
as U
a U
healthy U
activity U
for U
lowering U
the U
risk U
of U
heart U
disease U
he U
said U
So U
it U
has U
attracted U
people U
with U
a U
family U
history U
of U
early U
heart U
disease U
or U
early U
deaths U
and U
these U
are U
just U
the U
people U
who U
are U
likely U
to U
get U
into U
trouble U
In U
the U
31 U
cardiac U
arrests U
for U
which U
researchers U
could U
find U
a U
cause U
most U
were U
due U
to U
clogged U
hardened U
arteries U
or U
hypertrophic U
cardiomyopathy U
a U
sometimes U
inherited U
condition U
in U
which U
an U
unusually U
thick U
heart U
muscle U
can U
interfere U
with U
the U
pumping U
rhythm U
Most U
of U
the U
victims U
were U
unaware U
of U
their U
preexisting U
conditions U
Baggish U
said U

Baggish U
said U
he U
would U
encourage U
aspiring U
and U
experienced U
runners U
to U
talk U
to U
their U
doctors U
about U
their U
heart U
risks U
for U
distance U
running U
Dr U
Gordon U
Tomaselli U
president U
of U
the U
American U
Heart U
Association U
called U
the U
study U
reassuring U
for U
finding U
so U
few U
cardiac U
arrests U
For U
most U
people U
running U
a U
marathon U
if U
you U
are U
so U
inclined U
is U
a U
reasonably U
safe U
proposition U
he U
said U
Tomaselli U
a U
heart U
specialist U
at U
Johns U
Hopkins U
University U
also U
said U
runners U
should U
pay U
attention U
if U
they U
feel U
chest U
pain U
dizziness U
lightheadedness U
or U
unusually U
short U
breath U
or U
rapid U
heartbeat U
while U
running U
You U
should U
listen U
to U
your U
body U
he U
said U
In U
the U
same U

issue U
of U
the U
journal U
other U
doctors U
wrote U
a U
brief U
report U
about U
treating U
three U

who U
suffered U
heart U
attacks U
after U
finishing U
last U

Boston U

None U
had U
cardiac U

and U
all U
survived U
We U
do U
nt U
want U
to U
alarm U
people U
about U

running U
The U
benefits U

are U

the U
findings U

committee U
who U
bluntly U
state U
the U

The U

said U
it U
will U
be U
a U
very U
tall U
order U
to U
get U
NHS U
trusts U
to U
become U
foundation U
hospitals U
which U
are U
free U
from U

The U
committe U
warn U
that U
four U
out U
of U
five U
of U
the U
113 U
remaining U
trusts U
face U
financial U
difficulties U
Most U
face U
strategic U
challenges U
performance U
issues U
and U
governance U
problems U
Of U
these U
20 U
hospitals U
have U
declared U
that U
they U
will U
never U
make U
foundation U
status U
in U
their U
present U
circumstances U

and U
half U
of U
these U
are U
in U
London U
The U
MPs U
warn U
that U
while U
the U
department U
has U
said U
there U
are U
no U
current U
plans U
to U
close U
hospitals U
it U
is U
difficult U
to U
see U
why U
other U
organisations U
would U
want U
to U
take U
them U
on U
The U
chief U
executive U
of U
the U
NHS U
is U
only U
moderately U
confident U
that U
Londons U
hospital U
system U
can U
be U
turned U
round U
and U
acknowledged U
the U
unique U
challenges U
and U
obstacles U
to U
be U
overcome U
said U
Margaret U
Hodge U
chair U
of U
the U
committee U
She U
added U
that U
These U
trusts U
will U
be U
forced U
into U
reconfigurations U
or U
even U
mergers U
This U
may U
deal U
with U
the U
financial U
challenges U
involved U
but U
could U
leave U
some U
deprived U
communities U
with U
unequal U
access U
to U
high U
quality U
healthcare U

when U
hospital U
departments U
are U
closed U
and U
services U
moved U
The U
issues U
surrounding U
financing U
have U
also U
seen U
senior U
doctors U
resign U
in U
disgust U
at U
the U
cuts U
Yesterday U
it U
emerged U
that U
Guy U
Broome U
an U
orthopaedic U
surgeon U
who U
chaired U
the U
medical U
staff U
committee U
at U
debtridden U
North U
Cumbria U
University U
Hospitals U
NHS U
Trust U
told U
Pulse U
that U
he U
had U
resigned U
because U
patients U
were U
being U
denied U
care U
on U
financial U
rather U
than U
clinical U
grounds U
He U
also U
claimed U
the U
hospital U
had U
attempted U
to U
gag U
him U
from U
publicly U
voicing U
his U
fears U
about U
patient U
safety U
The U
trust U
denies U
both U
charges U
It U
is U
currently U
attempting U
to U

save U
15 U
m U
but U
said U
all U
decisions U
on U
care U
were U
clinically U
assessed U
Hodge U
said U
that U
the U
capital U
was U
of U
particular U
concern U
London U
is U
in U
a U
particularly U
shocking U
state U
and U
nobody U
has U
got U
a U
grip U
on U
longstanding U
problems U
We U
remain U
to U
be U
convinced U
that U
combining U
struggling U
hospitals U
into U
larger U
trusts U
as U
with U
South U
London U
will U
somehow U
produce U
viable U
organisations U
offering U
good U
quality U
accessible U
healthcare U
The U
health U
secretary U
had U
already U
threatened U
to U
managers U
that U
they U
would U
be U
removed U
and U
replaced U
if U
they U
failed U
to U
get U
hospitals U
ready U
to U
become U
foundation U
trusts U
by U
2014 U
Lansley U
has U
been U
extremely U
concerned U
that U
the U
deadline U
of U
2014 U
to U
get U

trusts U
up U
to U
scratch U
will U
be U
missed U
throwing U
into U
doubt U
whether U
his U
market U
reforms U
would U
work U
if U
hospitals U
were U
not U
free U
to U
compete U
for U
patients U
on U
a U
level U
playing U
field U
without U
the U
state U
in U
the U
form U
of U
the U
department U
of U
health U
intervening U
He U
points U
out U
that U
the U
committee U
found U
that U
two U
thirds U
of U
NHS U
trusts U
acknowledge U
they U
have U
performance U
and U
quality U
challenges U
and U
nearly U
40 U
say U
they U
need U
to U
strengthen U
their U
governance U
and U
their U
leadership U
Lansley U
says U
the U
roots U
of U
the U
current U
problem U
lie U
with U
Labours U
record U
especially U
of U
letting U
PFI U
costs U
escalate U
Todays U
report U
by U
the U
Public U
Accounts U
Committee U
confirms U
that U
Labour U
left U

some U
parts U
of U
the U
NHS U
with U
a U
dismal U
legacy U
of U
PFI U
bills U
hidden U
bailouts U
and U
in U
some U
cases U
inadequate U
leadership U
to U
face U
these U
challenges U
and U
those U
of U
the U
future U
They U
swept U
these U
problems U
under U
the U
carpet U
for U
a U
decade U
While U
there U
are U
plenty U
of U
top U
performing U
trust U
boards U
we U
are U
determined U
to U
root U
out U
poor U
performance U
by U
shining U
a U
light U
into U
every U
area U
of U
the U
service U
This U
includes U
independent U
assessments U
to U
help U
the U
NHS U
identify U
where U
things U
are U
going U
wrong U
so U
they U
can U
fix U
them U
Chris U
Ham U
of U

the U
Kings U

said U
the U
financial U
problems U
were U
so U
large U
that U
there U
needed U

a U
honest U

with U
the U

the U

toxic U
and U
carries U
the U

label U
The U
acute U
effects U

malathion U
depend U
on U
product U
purity U

the U
vehicle U
of U
administration U
Thus U
the U
LD50 U

Several U
other U
factors U
also U
affect U
the U
toxicity U

For U
example U
the U
toxicity U

malathion U
appeared U
to U
be U
strongly U
linked U
to U
the U
amount U
of U
protein U
in U
the U
diet U
of U
laboratory U
rats U
As U

intake U
decreased U
malathion U
was U
increasingly U
toxic U

to U
the U

Malathion U
has U
been U
shown U
to U
have U
different U
toxicities U
in U
male U
and U
female U
rats U
and U
humans U
due U
to U
metabolism U
storage U
and U
excretion U
differences U
between U
the U
sexes U
For U
humans U
the U
lowest U
dose U
at U
which U
lethal U
effects U
have U
been U
observed U
was U
nearly U
3 U
times U
higher U
for U

Acute U

that U

in U
Saudi U

were U
the U

that U

In U

Wednesday U

Aug U
2013 U
an U
international U
team U
of U
doctors U
blamed U
coronavirus U
in U
bats U
for U
the U
human U
outbreak U
but U
said U
that U
many U
questions U
remained U
in U
part U
because U
a U
perfect U
match U
for U
the U
virus U
was U
found U
in U

only U
a U
single U
insecteating U
bat U
out U
of U
about U
100 U
Saudi U
bats U
tested U
And U
since U
such U
bats U
do U
not U
normally U
bite U
people U
drool U
on U
fruit U
or U
do U
other U
things U
that U
might U
transmit U
the U
disease U
to U
people U
it U
was U
still U
unclear U
how U
the U
virus U
leapt U
to U
humansThe U
bat U
is U
a U
_ U
Taphozous U
perforatus U
_ U
or U
Egyptian U
tomb U
bat U
which U
roosts U
in U
abandoned U
buildings U
and U
the U
virus U
was U
found U
in U
a U
fecal U
sampleSo U
it U
is U
possible U
said U
Dr U
Jonathan U
H U
Epstein U
a U
veterinarian U
with U
the U
EcoHealth U
Alliance U
who U
helped U
trap U
the U
bats U
that U
victims U
like U

who U
might U

seek U
shelter U
in U
the U
buildings U
picked U
it U
up U
by U
breathing U
in U
dried U
bat U
guano U
similar U
to U
the U
way U
that U
Americans U
have U
been U
infected U
with U
hantavirus U
while U
sweeping U
up U
dried U
mouse U
droppingsBut U
it U
is U
also U
possible U
that U
an U
animal U
picked U
it U
up U
that U
way U
and U
then U
infected U
a U
human U
Pigs U
for U
instance U
can U
get U
Nipah U
virus U
from U
bats U
and U
then U
pass U
it U
to U
humans U
in U
slaughterhousesFurther U
tests U
on U
camels U
sheep U

Its U
a U
huge U
amount U
of U
work U
he U
saidIt U
has U
been U
known U
for U
several U
months U
that U
bats U
in U
Africa U
and U
Eastern U
Europe U
carried U
viruses U
related U
to U
MERS U
but U
the U
relevant U
virus U
had U
not U
been U
found U
in U
Middle U
Eastern U
bats U
before U
Camels U
in U
Oman U
have U
shown U
antibodies U
to U
a U
similar U
virusKnowing U
that U
one U
bat U
had U
an U
identical U
virus U
is U
a U
start U
but U
more U
testing U
will U
be U
needed U
said U

in U
Bisha U
a U
small U
Saudi U
Arabian U
city U
Investigators U
from U
Columbia U
and U
EcoHealth U
Alliance U
took U
samples U
there U
because U
the U
1st U
known U
victim U
of U
the U
MERS U
outbreak U
was U
a U
businessman U
who U
had U
lived U
in U
Bisha U
and U
had U
his U
business U
a U
large U
paint U
warehouse U
nearby U
The U
warehouse U
had U
a U
large U
garden U
with U
fruit U
trees U
and U
insects U
that U
attract U
many U
kinds U
of U
bats U
The U
victim U
a U
wealthy U
60yearold U
man U
got U
sick U
in U
midJune U
2012 U
and U
died U
2 U
weeks U
later U
Dr U

Lipkin U
saidThe U
victim U
also U
owned U
4 U
pet U
camels U
that U
were U
sampled U
but U
those U
results U
are U
not U
in U
yet U
Dr U
Lipkin U
added U
Samples U
taken U
from U
livestock U
in U
countries U
with U
endemic U
footandmouth U
disease U
must U
first U
be U
delivered U
to U
an U
Agriculture U
Department U
laboratory U
on U
Plum U
Island U
Massachusetts U
to U
be U
certified U
negative U
for U
footandmouth U
before U
they U
can U
be U
released U
for U
further U
testingThose U
restrictions U
can U
add U
months U
to U
the U
testing U
process U
Dr U
Memish U
said U
That U
is U
one U
reason U
the U
bat U
samples U
were U
tested U
sooner U
although U
other U
problems U
emerged U
1 U
of U
2 U
frozen U
shipments U
of U

samples U
the U
one U
the U
positive U
bat U
was U

in U
was U
opened U
at U
Customs U
on U
entry U
into U
the U
United U

and U
had U
thawed U
out U
by U
the U
time U
it U
reached U
Dr U
Lipkins U
lab U
48 U
hours U
laterWhat U
was U
recovered U
from U
that U
sample U
however U
was U
a U
100 U
percent U
match U
which U
is U
virtually U
unheard U
of U
in U
virology U
the U
study U
saidThe U
victim U
from U
Bisha U
had U
separate U
houses U
for U
his U
3 U
wives U
and U
was U
building U
a U
4th U
for U
a U
woman U
he U
planned U
to U
marry U
which U
suggests U
he U
was U
still U
vigorous U
Dr U
Lipkin U
saidBut U
most U
of U
those U
killed U
by U
the U
new U
virus U
were U
old U
and U
had U
chronic U
conditions U
like U
diabetes U
or U
heart U
disease U
Cases U
are U
being U
found U
of U
younger U

healthier U
victims U
who U
often U
have U
milder U
symptoms U
according U
to U
Dr U
Memish U
so U
it U
may U
soon U
be U
established U
that U
the U
diseases U
mortality U
rate U
is U
much U
lower U
than U
60 U

he U
only U
learned U
of U
the U

Memish U
said U
that U
by U
then U
it U
was U

not U
to U
come U
to U
the U
annual U

The U

Experts U
at U

are U
examining U
a U
silver U
Viking U
hoard U
that U
was U
found U
buried U
underground U
and U
could U

light U
on U
a U
murky U
period U
of U
history U
The U
hoard U
which U
includes U
more U
than U
200 U
coins U
and U
pieces U
of U
jewellery U
was U

in U
September U
by U
Darren U

using U
a U
metal U

on U
land U
around U
Silverdale U
in U
north U
Lancashire U
It U
includes U
a U
coin U
that U
is U
thought U
to U
refer U
to U
a U
previously U
unknown U
Viking U
ruler U
in U
northern U
England U
and U
also U
coins U
from U
the U

of U
Alfred U
the U
Great U
who U
reigned U
87199 U
and U
from U
the U
Viking U

kingdom U
of U

The U
hoard U
was U
placed U
in U
a U
lead U
box U
and U
buried U
underground U
at U
a U
time U
when U
the U
AngloSaxons U
were U
attempting U
to U
wrest U
control U
of U
the U
north U

London U
were U
called U
in U
after U
the U
hoard U
was U
reported U
as U
potential U
treasure U
A U
coroner U
will U
decide U
later U
this U
week U
whether U
it U
qualifies U
as U
treasure U
If U
it U
does U
an U
independent U
committee U
will U
value U
it U
and U
any U
money U
raised U
will U
be U
divided U
equally U
between U
Mr U
Webster U
and U
the U
landowner U
